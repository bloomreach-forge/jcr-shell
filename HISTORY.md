# History

## Origin

In 2008, Bart van der Schans < bart DOT vanderschans AT bloomreach DOT com >
originally implemented this jcr-shell Hippo Forge project.

Version 1.01.00, 1.01.01, 1.01.02 and 1.01.03 were released afterward.

## Putting in Attic

As the project had not been used popularly, it was put in Hippo Forge Attic SVN
repository at http://svn.onehippo.org/repos/hippo/attic/forge/jcr-shell
in March, 2017:

```
r58685 | 2017-03-02 05:42:11 -0500 (Thu, 02 Mar 2017) | 1 line
```

The root SVN repository is http://svn.onehippo.org/repos/hippo/, and the attic
SVN repository didn't store any revision history unfortunately.

## Reviving the project

In September, 2018, Woonsan Ko < woonsan DOT ko AT bloomreach DOT com >, decided
to volunteer reviving the project from the attic and maintaining the software,
after observing some people in the community had to fork and maintain copies of
the project just because Hippo Forge sent it to the attic in 2017.

Woonsan had to copy the latest trunk source into this github project at
https://github.com/onehippo-forge/jcr-shell as the revision history was totally missed.

Woonsan also bumped the project version to 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT as a new baseline version.
